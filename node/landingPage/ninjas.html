    <h1>About ninjas</h1>
    <p>
        The title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 4th-century prince Yamato Takeru.[17] In the Kojiki, the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people.[18] However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century.[19] Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century Shōmonki, the boy spy Koharumaru was
         killed for spying against the insurgent Taira no Masakado.
